# Blockchain Based Intelligent System to Ensure Occupational Safety and Fraud Prevention

# Abstract
Current  job  recruitment  process  involves  a  goodnumber  of  documentations.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  job  ap-plicants  to  misrepresent,  overstate  or  falsify  past  employment,specifically work experience, and skills. Where this occurs andthe  applicant  is  subsequently  appointed,  a  company  may  beexposed  to  significant  commercial  and  legal  risk.  Companiesusually  employ  third  party  HR  recruitment  agencies  to  verifythe   authenticity   of   an   applicant’s   listed   work   experience.However,  verification  of  applicant’s  past  work  experience  isboth  time  consuming  and  costly.  Moreover,  companies  haveto  rely  on  the  third  parties,  which  may  not  be  trustworthy.Therefore,  small  and  medium  size  companies  usually  avoidthe  verification  process.  In  this  research  ,  we  demonstratehow blockchain technology can provide cost-effective, and real-time  work  history  verification.  The  proposed  approach  alsoensures trustworthy and privacy-preserving (work-history)datasharing.  Furthermore,  we  have  implemented  a  prototype  todemonstrate how individuals can share and verify work historyusing  Ethereum-based  public  blockchain.Index  Terms— fraud  prevention,  work  history,  blockchain,data  sharing.
